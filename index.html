  <h4>Art</h4>
    <p>I've always referenced some sort of media in my art. For instance, I'd started out sketching ponies from one of my favorite TV shows as a child, My Little Pony. I then began drawing characters from my favorite anime. Then real people from Kpop groups or music videos. It wasn't until recently that I started drawing from life. My art is a prime example of how my life, and many others, are based on the consumption of media. It overwhelms us and impacts our creativity in doing so. Now I enjoy creating art inspired by my favorite video games.
